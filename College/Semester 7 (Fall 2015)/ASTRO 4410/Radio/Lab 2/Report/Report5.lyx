\begin_layout Abstract
Galactic rotation curves are mysterious entities.
 Their shape cannot be explained by a n√§ive application of the law of universal
 gravitation, as the amount and distribution of visible matter is inconsistent
 with observed rotation curves measured for most spiral galaxies.
 Instead of finding that the orbital velocity of material decreases with
 increasing distance from the galactic center, studies have found that this
 velocity is approximately constant; that is, that rotation curves are approxima
tely flat, starting from a radius relatively close to the center.
 The rotation curve of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, has been shown to
 be consistent with this model.
 This lab is an attempt to derive the magnitude of the rotational velocity
 of the galaxy under the assumption that the curve is perfectly flat, based
 on observations of hydrogen gas made with a Cornell University's radio
 telescope.
 The results will show that the assumption of a completely flat rotation
 curve leads to some errors, at least in the case of the longitudes that
 were scanned.
 I will proceed to argue that nevertheless, the results make complete sense,
 and will illustrate this by plotting the rotation curve of the galaxy assuming
 that the Sun's rotational velocity is known.
 I will also use the obtained data to estimate the radius of the galaxy.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, one of the most impressive achievements
 of human ingenuity, has been used with brilliant accuracy in order to predict
 the motions of celestial bodies.
 It allows us to make sense of the dynamics of our solar system, and can
 be used to make predictions about the movements of everything from asteroids
 and comets to moons and planets.
 Newtonian dynamics and gravitation were responsible for taking us to the
 moon.
 Nonetheless, its predictions regarding some specific phenomena have been
 proven incorrect.
 Some of these incorrect predictions, like the perihelion precession of
 Mercury, or the quantitative description of gravitational lensing, were
 solved by Einstein's General Relativity, which in effect superseded Newtonian
 gravity as the correct theory of gravitation.
 However, not even General Relativity is able to explain, without the help
 of certain untested hypotheses, the shape of the Milky Way's rotation curve
 or, for that matter, the shape of the rotation curve of most galaxies that
 we can observe.
 That is, we expect the rotational velocity of the material in the galaxy
 to decrease, after a certain radius, as a function of distance from the
 center, but instead we see that it is more or less constant as a function
 of increasing radius, as illustrated in Figure 1.
 This lab reproduces this perplexing result, and explores the limitations
 of treating the rotational velocity of objects in the galaxy as a constant,
 using the radio telescope mounted on the roof of Cornell University's Space
 Sciences Building.

Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Date of observations and telescope characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data for this lab was acquired on Monday, November 23rd, from approximately
 14:30 to 15:30, using the radio telescope mounted in the roof of Cornell
 University's Space Sciences Building.
 The antenna's reflector is a 3.8 m paraboloid with a helical feed at the
 prime focus that accepts circularly polarized radiation between 1 and 2
 GHz.
 Behind the helix there is a circular ground plane where the antenna terminals
 connect to a receiver box that contains a low-noise amplifier and a noise
 diode that can be used for calibration purposes.
 This antenna is mounted on a king post that allows it to move in azimuth
 and elevation.
 The signal produced by the low-noise amplifier is sent to an analog receiver
 in a lab room in the floor directly below the roof.
 The signal goes through a bandpass filter that selects a 57 MHz band around
 1420 MHz, and is then mixed into an intermediate frequency, and a second
 bandpass filter centered at 260 MHz is used to eliminate aliasing.
 The antenna's movement and orientation is controlled by a computer in the
 same lab room, which is also used for producing the data files generated
 by the observations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Procedures for data acquisition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data acquisition consisted in having the antenna point towards nine
 different galactic longitudes in the galactic plane, plus seven different
 latitudes ranging from 0 to 12 degrees at a longitude of 55 degrees (in
 galactic coordinates).
 Sets of three or more spectra were obtained for each of the directions
 at which the antenna was pointed.
 Each of the spectra consists of 787 channels spaced over a 10 Mhz band
 centered at 1420 MHz, the 21 cm hydrogen line.
 The galaxy is composed mostly of hydrogen gas, so we expect to detect this
 line near its rest frequency, but redshifted or blueshifted depending on
 the velocity of the gas relative to us.
 Finding this Doppler shift is central to achieving the lab's objectives,
 as will be seen below.

 Since we are looking at galactic hydrogen, and not at a particular star,
 we will always observe some hydrogen that has 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0$
\end_inset

 with respect to us.
 Assuming a flat rotation curve implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $V=V_{0}$

Radius

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming a flat rotation curve, the relationship between the maximum distance
 from the center of the galaxy for the observed hydrogen cloud, or its maximum
 radius, and its minimum velocity as per the spectrum obtained with the
 antenna is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph default
is the minimum velocity, which can be obtained from the spectrum in the
 same way as the maximum velocity was in 4.1, via equation (4), but instead
 of finding the point at which the value of the signal reaches 20% of it's
 maximum value, the point to be found corresponds to the frequency at which
 the signal falls to 20% of it's maximum value after passing through the
 maximum.
 In other words, 
\emph on
f
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 can be regarded as the point at which there is no more hydrogen to be found,
 and provides a good estimate for the radius of the galaxy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Corrections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that the Sun has a certain peculiar velocity with respect to the
 other objects in our neighborhood implies that a certain correction must
 be made to the velocities obtained in parts 4.1 and 4.2 above.
 This is given by 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{\text{ ò}}=19.5\, kms^{-1}(cos(b)cos(23¬∞)cos(l-57\text{¬∞})+sin(b)sin23\text{¬∞})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

accounts for this motion and eliminates this source of error.
 In addition to this, the Earth's orbital velocity and its rotation about
 its own axis also affect the velocities obtained, to a degree dependent
 on the time of the day and year, and the galactic longitude and latitude
 being observed.
 All of this was accounted for during the data reduction process via use
 of JPL's Solar System ephemeris DE405.

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in the table, the obtained value for the rotational velocity is
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{0}=263.6\pm72.1\, kms^{-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing this to Figure 1, which gives 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{sun}=V_{0}\thickapprox220\, kms^{-1}$
\end_inset

, the obtained value is consistent with expectations since the expected
 value is within the range allowed by the error bounds, and it is relatively
 close to the average value found.
 However, an honest assessment appears to suggest that 
\emph on

\emph default
is directly proportional to 
\emph on
l
\emph default
, as illustrated in Figure 5.
 Thus it seems that assuming a flat rotation curve leads to a contradiction,
 since calculating the rotational velocities at different longitudes under
 this assumption leads to the conclusion that the rotation curve is not,
 in fact, perfectly flat, but instead is proportional to the longitude.
 A better result could be obtained by taking into account measurements only
 between the longitude range 
\begin_inset Formula $30\text{¬∞}<l<40\text{¬∞}$
\end_inset

, but justifying this sort of range choice does not appear to be possible
 without resorting to some sort of

A better way of determining whether the results obtained are accurate is
 to use them in order to plot a portion of the Milky Way's rotation curve
 and compare it with accepted models.
 Instead of assuming that the rotation curve is perfectly flat as was done
 in 5.1, here it will be assumed that equation (1) holds in its original
 form and that the value of

The velocities fall within a reasonable range of values given the expectations,
 and the shape of the curve is approximately flat.
 Clearly, this method produces much better results than the one used in
 5.1, and confirms that the data obtained is reasonably accurate.
 Even more accurate results might be obtained by utilization of more sophisticat
ed code in order to do the analysis, as well as by performing more closely
 spaced measurements over a wider range of longitudes.
 Nonetheless, these results show that a respectable galactic rotation curve
 for the Milky Way galaxy can be obtained by using a 3.8 m telescope and
 a relatively crude data reduction method.

The data obtained indicates that

 Since the Milky Way's diameter is supposed to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\thickapprox30\, kpc$
\end_inset

, it can be said that the measurements are in reasonable agreement with
 the accepted value.
 There is not much dispersion in the values obtained for each of the longitudes,
 and there does not appear to be a clear relationship between longitude
 and

 As in 5.2, more accurate results might be obtained by utilization of more
 sophisticated code during the data reduction process, and by performing
 more closely spaced measurements over a wider range of longitudes.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this lab was to use spectra of hydrogen gas captured by Cornell's
 Space Sciences radio telescope at different galactic longitudes in order
 to study the rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy.
 This was done by first attempting to obtain a single value for the rotational
 velocity of hydrogen assuming that the rotation curve was perfectly flat,
 then plotting a rotation curve dropping this assumption, and finally by
 estimating the galactic radius on the basis of the observations.
 It was found that assuming a perfectly flat rotation curve leads to a contradic
tion, but that plotting the curve without assuming flatness results in an
 approximately flat curve, so averaging the values found using the second
 method leads to a better estimate of the rotational velocity of objects
 orbiting the center of the galaxy than attempting to find this velocity
 by assuming flatness from the start.
 The values for 
\emph on

 obtained were consistent with expectations and serve as a further indication
 that the quality of data obtained was good.
 Finally, it was suggested that better results might be obtained for all
 of the parameters via utilization of a more sophisticated code for data
 reduction and by performing more closely spaced measurements over a wider
 range of galactic longitudes.
