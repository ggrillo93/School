Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was performed using an Andor IDus 440 CCD mounted on a flat
 table and attached to a camera lens.
 The first three results were obtained by placing the CCD some 50 cm away
 from a white piece of paper.
 This white piece of paper was pasted to a wooden bar in order to keep it
 flat and upright.
 A light bulb connected to a variable power source was placed directly behind
 the paper and the bar.
 In an effort to create a flat field from which to acquire data from, the
 brightness of the light bulb was adjusted and the variable power source
 was set at a constant voltage for all measurements.
 The lights of the room were turned off for the duration of the exposure
 time on each occasion data was acquired.
 Results for the blooming part were obtained using a different setup, with
 the white piece of paper replaced by a pigeon hole that was placed around
 the lightbulb in order to create a point source.
 The CCD was connected to a computer that was used to control it and receive
 the data it obtained.
 The computer's screen was also turned off whenever measurements were made.
 The CCD was set to a temperature of -40 Â°C.
 The software used to obtain and save the data was the 'Andor Solis' package
 developed by the CCD's manufacturers.

Read noise and bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data for this part of the lab was acquired from five exposures timed to
 be as short as possible, which in practice corresponded to 0.00001 seconds.
 The camera lens cap was kept in its covering position.
 The read noise was calculated by taking the standard deviation of the values
 of the pixels contained in the image obtained by the CCD and averaging
 over the values recovered for each of the exposures.
 The bias was calculated by measuring the average value of the pixels contained
 in the images, and again averaging over the five exposures.
 All of these results can be seen on Table 1.

Dark current
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dark current is the current that flows through a CCD that is not due
 to photon collisions but to thermal fluctuations in it.
 Its value is given by the slope of the line obtained by graphing the average
 number of counts DN per pixel in terms of the respective exposure time.
 The average number of counts per image was calculated using all of the
 image's pixels, and nine different images were taken, each using a different
 exposure time.
 The results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1.
 The value of the dark current was calculated as

\begin_layout Subsection
Gain factor and photon transfer curve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gain factor 
\emph on
G
\emph default
 enables conversion from DN's to electrons.
 In this experiment, its value was calculated by taking several pictures
 of the white piece of paper with the light bulb behind it at constant brightnes
s and varying the exposure time for each picture.
 In total, 18 pictures were taken, with exposure times ranging from 0.1 seconds
 to 100 seconds.
 Examination of each of the pictures determined that a fairly uniform region
 could be selected from the bottom right corner of each of them.
 A 20 by 20 pixel box corresponding to this region was used to calculate
 the noise and the signal for each of the pictures.
 Noise was calculated as the standard deviation of the group of pixels and
 the signal was calculated as its average value.
 Plotting the log of the noise obtained as a function of the log of the
 signal minus the bias obtained before results in the CCD photon transfer
 curve, shown in Figure 2.
 Removing the first five points of the photon transfer curve, which are
 dominated by read noise, produces Figure 3.
 In theory, the best fit line for Figure 3 should have a value of 1/2, because
 this part of the transfer curve is dominated by photon noise, and photon
 noise is proportional to the square root of 
\emph on
N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
e
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
, the number of signal electrons in a well, while the signal is directly
 proportional to 
\emph on
N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
e
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
.
 Thus this kind of graph can in theory be used to obtain the exact value
 of the gain factor 
\emph on
G
\emph default
 by extending the 1/2 slope line and would be given by the value of the
 point at which the line intercepts the x-axis.
 Unfortunately, the value of the best fit line for Figure 3 is not 1/2 but
 0.618, which means that utilization of this method does not produce an accurate
 result.
 An attempt was made anyway and the value was found to be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=0.6369\:\frac{e^{-}}{DN}
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to obtain another estimation that would allow to get a more accurate
 value for the gain constant, an alternative approach was also tried, which
 relied on using the formula 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=\frac{S(DN)}{\sigma_{S}^{2}(DN)-\sigma_{R}^{2}(DN)}
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
was obtained by plotting the signal S(DN) vs the square of the noise minus
 the square of the read noise calculated earlier for each of the 20 by 20
 pixel boxes obtained from the images.
 This method produced a value for 
\emph on
G
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=0.5691\:\frac{e^{-}}{DN}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That plot is shown by Graph 4.
 The average of the two values of 
\emph on
G
\emph default
 gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{av}=0.6030\:\frac{e^{-}}{DN}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using 
\emph on
G
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
av
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
as the gain constant, the value of the read noise can now be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{R}=0.7310\: e^{-}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the value of the dark current as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d(DN)}{dt}=0.01200\:\frac{e^{-}}{s}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The full well capacity cannot be calculated using this data for reasons
 that will be explained later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It must be noted here that the fact that the value of the slope of Figure
 3 is not 1/2 might be explained by an imperfect field produced during the
 experiment.
 In other words, the field measured by the CCD, with a physical basis on
 the illuminated part of the white piece of paper, was not a flat field,
 maybe because of experimental error.
 This is supported by the fact that when the size of the box used to calculate
 the signal and noise values is increased, the slope of Figure 3 increases,
 even though the selected area is still within what looks like a uniform
 region of the acquired image.
 The increase in slope implies an increase in the standard deviation of
 the pixels, which points towards the conclusion that the field produced
 in the experiment was not flat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 2 shows the complete photon transfer curve for the experiment, incorporat
ing the points that were not plotted on Figures 3 and 4.
 In theory, this plot should have contained three different regimes characterize
d by three different curve shapes as exemplified by Figure 5.
 The first regime is dominated by read noise, the second by photon noise,
 and the third by fixed pattern noise.
 As can be immediately seen, Figure 2 shows only two different regimes,
 not three as was expected.
 This can be readily explained by the fact that the exposure times used
 were never high enough to reach the saturation level of the wells.
 We have already examined the second region, which was used to approximate
 the value of the gain constant.
 The discrepancy between the expected shape of the curve and the observed
 one for the first region is harder to explain.
 It might be possible that the read noise is not a constant and changed
 as a function of the signal, but it is not easy to see why this would be
 the case.
 Another, more plausible possibility is that the lack of flatness of the
 field might have affected the relationship between the noise and the signal
 for low values.

\begin_layout Subsection
Linearity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linearity of a CCD relates to the behavior of the signal it produces
 as a function of the exposure time of the images it captures.
 An ideal CCD would be perfectly linear, with its signal being directly
 proportional to the exposure time.
 The nonlinearity of the CCD can be expressed as a percentage through the
 following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma=\frac{Max\: positive\: deviation-Max\: negative\: deviation}{Maximum\: signal}\times100
\]

 Where the maximum positive and negative deviations corresponds to the maximum
 distance between a series of signal values from their best fit line in
 a plot of signal vs exposure time, and the maximum signal is the largest
 signal plotted.
 Using the same set of data as for calculating the 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
factor, two 20 by 20 boxes were selected for each image, one on the upper
 left corner and the other on the bottom right corner.
 The signal vs exposure times were later plotted, and the nonlinearity of
 each of these lines was calculated and then averaged.
 Figures 6, 7 and 8 show plots for different sets of exposure times and
 their respective nonlinearity values.
 Figure 6 contains all images captured, while Figure 7 contains all images
 with exposure times greater or equal to 5 seconds.
 Finally, Figure 8 contains all images with exposure times less or equal
 to 20 seconds.
 The value of gamma was also calculated for three other sets.
 These are shown in Table 3.

There does not appear to be a clear relationship between the nonlinearity
 of the data sets and their exposure times.
 One conclusion that can be drawn is that the data is almost perfectly linear
 for the first few points, and then it increases to a value close to 1%.
 Another conclusion that this data appears to point towards is that distortions
 due to the opening and closing of the shutter are not noticeable.
 Measurements with exposure times of less than 0.1 second might have produced
 different results, but these were not made.

\begin_layout Subsection
Blooming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blooming is the name given to a particular phenomenon that affects images
 produced by a CCD that has been exposed to a photon field that contains
 a high concentration of photons in a small area.
 After a long enough exposure, these photons overwhelm the electron wells
 that map that particular area of the field, and they start overflowing
 with electrons that proceed to fall into adjacent wells, producing the
 illusion of a signal in places where photons are not actually arriving
 at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observation of blooming in this experiment was done by exposing the CCD
 to a point light source and then taking a total of four exposures, each
 two times longer than the previous one, starting with a 1 second exposure.
 Blooming was observed for both the 4 and 8 second exposures.
 For each of the images captured, the pixel that contained the maximum counts
 was located and its value measured.
 Table 4 shows the results of these measurements and Figure 9 contains a
 plot of the maximum counts vs the exposure time.
 The relationship between signal and exposure time was found to be nonlinear,
 which is to be expected since some of the electron wells in charge of measuring
 the signal coming from the direction of the point source were overwhelmed.
 Thus, they were unable to measure the total signal coming from the source,
 instead redistributing electrons into adjacent wells, essentially sharing
 data counts with them.
 This means that the expected shape of the plot would be one were the difference
 between the maximum data count for each of the exposures would decrease
 as the exposure time increased, which corresponds to the actual shape observed.
 This is made more explicit in Table 4.
