\begin_layout Subsection
Target object
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The target object was the spiral galaxy NGC 7331, located at a distance
 of 12.2 Â± 1.0 Mpc from Earth.
 It is located in the constellation Pegasus, and it's

Image acquisition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observations were made during the night of October 7th, 2015 at the Hartung-Boot
hroyd Observatory (HBO) located at Mount Pleasant, Ithaca, NY.
 The HBO houses the James R.
 Houck telescope, a fork mounted cassegrain reflector telescope whose primary
 mirror is 25 inches (0.635 meters) in diameter.
 It has a f/13.5 lens, with a native plate scale of 24 arcsec/mm.
 Photon detection was performed using an Andor iDus 440 CCD, which sports
 a coated e2v CCD 42-10 BV sensor.
 Image resolution was of 2048 by 512 pixels, with a pixel size of 13.5e-6
 m, a plate scale of 0.3''/pixel, a field of view of 10.7' by 2.6', and a read
 noise of 4 e

.
 A spectrograph was used in order to decompose the light coming from the
 target object into a spectrum (Figure 1).
 This spectrum can be regarded as a three dimensional plot, with decreasing
 wavelength from left to right along the x-axis, and the value of each pixel
 correlates with the intensity of the corresponding spectral line.
 The bright band that covers the entire image near the vertical center from
 left to right is NGC 7331, so different values for the y-axis correlate
 with different distances away from the galaxy's center.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bias and flat noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before observations began, 10 images with exposure time of 0.00001 seconds
 were taken in order to obtain data that was later used to compensate for
 bias.
 No photons were allowed to enter the CCD while these images were taken.
 In addition to this, 50 images of exposure time of 2 seconds under a flat
 bright light field were performed in order to properly compensate for imperfect
ions in the subsequent image acquisition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data reduction was performed using Python.
 The original 231 transit images containing the target star and several
 others were inspected in order to look for obvious errors.
 It was found that image number 132 was considerably brighter than the rest,
 so it was not used in the analysis.
 The bias was calculated by averaging, pixel by pixel, the 10 zero second
 exposures performed before observation.
 This bias was substracted, again pixel by pixel, from each of the transit
 images.
 Compensating for the flat noise involved finding the pixelwise median for
 each of the flat images taken and then dividing by their average, again
 pixel by pixel.
 Then, each of the transit images were divided pixelwise by the flat noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracking of the target star was performed by comparing the position of the
 star in the first image vs the position of the star in the final image,
 enabling the construction of a box that was able to encompass the star
 in each of the 230 images without encompassing other surrounding stars.
 This box was subsequently analyzed, image by image, in order to locate
 its maximum value in each of them, thus finding the coordinates of the
 star's center for every one of the images.
 Finally, these coordinates were used to construct a new, smaller box centered
 on the star with its edges effectively framing it, obtaining something
 akin to a circle (the star) inscribed in a square (the box).
 Obtaining the relative brightness of the star for each of the images was
 then done simply by calculating the average of the values of the pixels
 within that box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensating for atmospheric effects involved using the same tracking technique
 described above on another star within the field that was always present
 throughout the images, calculating its brightness in each case, then scaling
 and subtracting that brightness to the target star's at the corresponding
 observation time.
 The scaling was done using the data points at t=175 (image number 175)
 at which point none of the stars was undergoing transit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the previous steps returned a list of 230 values which corresponded
 to the adjusted relative brightness of the target star for each of the
 acquired images.
 Since the star was supposed to be undergoing a planetary transit during
 the time the data was obtained, plotting this list of values as a function
 of time should produce a planetary transit curve.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 contains the complete planetary transfer curve extracted from the
 observations.
 It is immediately apparent that the results are not perfect.
 In particular, there are two things that must be analyzed in more detail.
 First of all, the choice of scale point caused the observed brightness
 to start at about 101% instead of 100%, as would be expected.
 However, careful observation reveals that there is only one point at or
 near B=1.01, with the following point being near B=1.005, so the error is
 not too big so as not to be possible to attribute it to noise that was
 not taken into account during data processing.
 For instance, it must be noted that there was no adjustment done in order
 to compensate for limb darkening, and the code used to analyze the images
 assumed that the center of the star was located at the pixel that had the
 maximum relative brightness, which is not necessarily true.
 Calculation of the planet's radius will be done by ignoring this 0.5% discrepanc
y and taking the percentage darkening to be unity minus the minimum value
 of the brightness that can be extracted from the plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other thing that demands an explanation is the shape of the curve after
 t=175.
 Instead of the star's brightness being constant from that point on, our
 observations appear to imply that after reaching its original value, the
 brightness starts going down again, which of course does not make sense
 since the planetary transit was already over.
 I do not have a completely satisfying explanation for this.
 It is possible that it is just noise: that some atmospheric phenomenon
 that was not accounted for (such as a cloud) produced uneven distortion
 that only affected either the target start or the star used to compensate
 for atmospheric effects.
 A more detailed analysis, taking into account the brightness evolution
 of more of the stars observed throughout the night could determine whether
 this hypothesis is correct.
 For now, though, it is possible to ignore this noise and use the curve
 from Figure 2 in order to estimate the radius of the planet.

An estimate of the planetary radius can be made by looking at the percentage
 of brightness coming from the star that the planet was able to block, which
 can be obtained by looking at the lowest point in the transit curve.
 This can be quantified by the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{L_{T}}{L_{0}}=1-\left(\frac{R_{P}}{R_{S}}\right)^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where L
\begin_inset script subscript

is the star's original brightness, L
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
T

is the star's brightness with the planet under transit, R
\begin_inset script subscript

P
\end_layout

\end_inset

is the planet's radius, and R
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
S
\end_layout

\end_inset

is the star's radius.
 Solving for R
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
P

\end_inset

, we have:
\end_layout

 is
\begin_inset Formula

\frac{L_{T}}{L_{0}}=0.9765\pm0.0035
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
The radius of the star is (from the Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{S}=(0.783\pm0.071)R_{Sun}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

Plugging this into (2) gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{P}=(0.120\pm0.014)R_{Sun}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

The same Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia gives the radius of the planet
 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{P}=(1.08\pm0.02)R_{J}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With R
\begin_inset script subscript

 Since
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{Sun}=9.73R_{J}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{P}=(1.17\pm0.14)R_{J}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which, given the instrumentation used and the not very sophisticated method
 used to analyze the data, is in reasonable agreement with the accepted
 value.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this lab was to observe a planetary transit using the James
 R.
 Houck telescope at HBO, extract a planetary transit curve from the data
 obtained and use this curve to find the radius of the planet in question,
 in this case, WASP-10b.
 The objectives were fulfilled and reasonable agreement was obtained between
 the results obtained and those that were expected, save for a strange feature
 of the curve that was mentioned in section 4.1, but which does not appear
 to have affected the calculation of the planetary radius.
 Further refinements in the data reduction process, as well as data from
 other transit events for the same planet, would probably produce a better
 estimate for the planetary radius, but this can be regarded as a good first
 approximation.
