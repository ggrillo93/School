\begin_layout Abstract
We present the results of a series of experiments designed to study the
 reflection and refraction properties of a flat mirror, water, a prism,
 and a slab, with the latter two sharing an identical composition.
 There are six experiments in total.
 The first attempts to verify the law of reflection, the second finds the
 refractive index of tap water at room temperature, and the remaining four
 find the refractive index of the prism and slab's glass using different
 methods.
 Our results agree with expectations to varying degrees, and find that in
 particular the different methods for finding the refractive index of the
 glass significantly vary in terms of their relative accuracy.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding the propagation of electromagnetic waves at the interface
 between two media is one of the most important areas of inquiry in optics.
 During reflection and refraction, an electromagnetic wave changes speed
 and direction as it comes into contact with the interface, in the first
 case propagating back into the original medium, while in the second propagating
 from the original medium into the new one.
 In practice, both reflection and refraction occur whenever an electromagnetic
 wave is incident on a surface, as part of the wave's energy is transmitted
 from one medium to the other, and another part of it is reflected.
 We will see that we can measure the refractive index of a material in several
 different ways by exploring how the material reflects and transmits light
 via relatively simple experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is divided as folllows.
 Section 2 gives an overview of the background theory and geometry required
 to understand each of the experiments performed, with derivations of the
 equations used and the physical basis behind them.
 Section 3 describes the experimental setup for each of the experiments,
 and section 4 presents the results obtained and the procedures used in
 the reduction of the data.
 Section 5 analyses the results.
 Finally, we develop general conclusions in Section 6.

\begin_layout Subsection
Law of reflection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The law of reflection is the statement that the angle of reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{r}$
\end_inset

 of the wave, due to its scattering as it impinges on a flat surface, is
 equal to its angle of incidence 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\theta_{i}=\theta_{r}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

A simple derivation of this law can be found in [1].
 Both of these angles are measured with respect to the normal of the surface
 that performs the reflection of the wave.
 Note that this law applies only when the mirror is large compared to the
 wavelength of the wave, enabling the electrons at the surface to oscillate
 in phase with each other when they absorb and emit the energy carried by
 the wave.
 In the context of this project, this condition holds, so we expect the
 law of reflection to apply.

\begin_layout Standard
Snell's Law relates the refractive indices of two media to the respective
 incident and transmitted angles of a ray of light as it propagates from
 one medium to the other.
 Let the refractive index of the originating medium be 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the refractive index of the medium into which the wave propagates be
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

, and let the incident and transmitted angles at the interface be 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{t}$
\end_inset

, respectively, and according to Snell's Law
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n_{i}\sin\theta_{i}=n_{r}\sin\theta_{t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the law of reflection can be recovered from this statement,
 since in the case of reflection, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}=n_{r}$
\end_inset

, and thus it follows that the incidence angle is equal to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transmitted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 angle, which in this case is the reflected angle.
 A proper derivation of Snell's Law can be found in [1].
 Note that the refractive index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of a material is related to the speed of light in vacuum 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and the speed of light in the medium 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n=\frac{c}{v}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which implies that light travels at different velocities in different media.
 The refractive index of air 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{air}\approx1$
\end_inset

, a fact that will be used extensively throughout this work.
 In the second experiment of this report, we will use Snell's Law and the
 geometry shown in Figure 1 in order to find the refractive index of water
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{w}$
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{mt}=d_{mw}+d_{wt}$
\end_inset

, and we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\theta_{i}=\arctan\left(\frac{a}{d_{mt}}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\theta_{t}=\arctan\left(\frac{b-c}{d_{wt}}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The rules for similar triangles allow us to write 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c=\frac{ad_{mw}}{d_{mt}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

By Snell's law, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n_{w}=\frac{n_{air}\sin\theta_{i}}{\sin\theta_{t}}=\frac{\sin\theta_{i}}{\sin\theta_{t}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Combining equations (4)-(7) gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
n_{w} & = & \frac{\sin\left[\arctan\left(\frac{a}{d_{mt}}\right)\right]}{\sin\left[\arctan\left(\frac{b}{d_{wt}}-\frac{ad_{mw}}{d_{wt}d_{mt}}\right)\right]}\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{a}{bd_{mt}-ad_{mw}}\sqrt{\frac{\left(bd_{mt}-ad_{mw}\right)^{2}+d_{mt}^{2}d_{wt}^{2}}{a^{2}+d_{mt}^{2}}}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin_layout Standard
The index of refraction 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of a transparent triangular prism can be calculated by determining the
 angle of minimum deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{min}$
\end_inset

, which can be derived from the geometry of Figure 2.
 From the figure, it can be seen that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and the angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{3}$
\end_inset

 are related by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
(90^{\circ}-\theta_{2})+\varepsilon+(90^{\circ}-\theta_{3})=180\textdegree
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon=\theta_{2}+\theta_{3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Whereas the angle of deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta=(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2})+(\theta_{4}-\theta_{3})=\theta_{1}+\theta_{4}-\varepsilon
\end{equation}

\end_inset

By symmetry, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{min}$
\end_inset

 must occur when 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}=\theta_{4}$
\end_inset

, which in turn implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}=\theta_{3}$
\end_inset

, which means that equations (10) and (11) become
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\varepsilon & = & 2\theta_{2}\\
\delta_{min} & = & 2\theta_{1}-\varepsilon
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Using Snell's Law and taking into account that the medium to either side
 of the prism is air, we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\sin\theta_{1} & = & n\sin\theta_{2}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and using equations (12) and (13), we obtain a way for calculating the
 refractive index of the prism
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n=\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\delta_{min}+\varepsilon}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)}
\end{equation}

 oriented at an angle

\end_inset

 with respect to the incident beam of light and the displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

, as shown on Figure 3, can be derived again via Snell's Law.
 As described in [2], we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta x=(d\tan\theta-d\tan\theta')\cos\theta=d\sin\theta\left[1-\frac{\cos\theta}{\sqrt{n^{2}-\sin^{2}\theta}}\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For the purposes of this experiment, is it useful to rewrite this equation
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta x}{d}=\sin\theta\left[1-\frac{\cos\theta}{\sqrt{n^{2}-\sin^{2}\theta}}\right]

\begin_layout Standard
The phenomenon of total internal reflection occurs when a ray of light propagati
ng from a medium with refractive index 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 into a medium with refractive index 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}>n_{t}$
\end_inset

 is completely reflected back towards the original medium, that is, the
 transmitted intensity of the beam is equal to zero.
 The minimum angle at which this happens is known as the critical angle
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}=\theta_{c}$
\end_inset

, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{t}=90^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 By Snell's Law,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sin\theta_{i}=\frac{n_{t}}{n_{i}}\sin\theta_{t}\rightarrow\sin\theta_{c}=\frac{n_{t}}{n_{i}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the present experiment, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}=n$
\end_inset

 will be the refractive index of a 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 transparent glass prism, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}=n_{air}$
\end_inset

, so (18) becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sin\theta_{c}=\frac{1}{n}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now let a beam of light impinge on one of the faces of the prism with an
 angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 as depicted in Figure 4.
 The geometry of the setup gives the following equation relating the angles
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}'$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{c}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon-\phi_{c}'-\theta_{c}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

By Snell's law, we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sin\phi_{c}'=\frac{\sin\phi_{c}}{n}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Combining equations (19)-(21) gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n}=\sin(\varepsilon-\phi_{c}')=\sin\left[\varepsilon-\arcsin\left(\frac{\sin\phi_{c}}{n}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Applying the trigonometric identities 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(a-b)=\sin(a)\cos(b)-\cos(a)\sin(b)$
\end_inset

 allows us to write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{n} & = & \sin\varepsilon\cos\left[\arcsin\left(\frac{\sin\phi_{c}}{n}\right)\right]-\cos\varepsilon\sin\left[\arcsin\left(\frac{\sin\phi_{c}}{n}\right)\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & \sin\varepsilon\cos\left[\arcsin\left(\frac{\sin\phi_{c}}{n}\right)\right]-\frac{\cos\varepsilon\sin\phi_{c}}{n}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 And since 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\left[\arcsin\left(a\right)\right]=\sqrt{1-a^{2}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{n}=\sin\varepsilon\sqrt{1-\frac{\sin^{2}\phi_{c}}{n^{2}}}-\frac{\cos\varepsilon\sin\phi_{c}}{n}
\]

\end_inset

Some further elementary algebra yields the following expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{2}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n^{2}=\sin^{2}\phi_{c}+\left(\frac{1+\cos\varepsilon\sin\phi_{c}}{\sin\varepsilon}\right)^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Expanding the square of the expression in parenthesis and adding yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n^{2} & = & \frac{1+2\cos\varepsilon\sin\phi_{c}+\cos^{2}\varepsilon\sin^{2}\phi_{c}+\sin^{2}\varepsilon\sin^{2}\phi_{c}}{\sin^{2}\varepsilon}\\
 & = & \frac{1+2\cos\varepsilon\sin\phi_{c}+\sin^{2}\phi_{c}\left(\cos^{2}\varepsilon+\sin^{2}\varepsilon\right)}{\sin^{2}\varepsilon}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Finally, using the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos^{2}a+\sin^{2}a=1$
\end_inset

 gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
n^{2} & = & \frac{\cos^{2}\varepsilon+\sin^{2}\varepsilon+2\cos\varepsilon\sin\phi_{c}+\sin^{2}\phi_{c}}{\sin^{2}\varepsilon}\nonumber \\
 & = & 1+\frac{\cos^{2}\varepsilon+2\cos\varepsilon\sin\phi_{c}+\sin^{2}\phi_{c}}{\sin^{2}\varepsilon}\nonumber \\
n & = & \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\cos\varepsilon+\sin\phi_{c}}{\sin\varepsilon}\right)^{2}}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsection
Reflectivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reflectivity 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 of an interface is defined as the ratio of the intensities of the reflected
 wave and the incident wave, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{r}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R=\frac{I_{0}}{I_{r}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The relationship between a material's refraction index and it's reflection
 coefficient, assuming the material is surrounded by air, can be derived
 as follows.
 An electromagnetic wave incident on the material is, in general, reflected
 and refracted, with part of the wave's energy being transmitted into the
 material, and part of it being reflected back towards the original medium
 from which it came from.
 For a wave polarized in such a way that the electric field 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{E}$
\end_inset

 is perpendicular to the plane of incidence, the tangential components of
 the electric field at either side of the interface are continuous, or in
 other words,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{E}_{0i}+\vec{E}_{0r}=\vec{E}_{0t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the quantities on the left hand side are the magnitudes of the incident
 and reflected electric fields, respectively, and the one on the right hand
 side is the magnitude of the transmitted electric field.
 The electric field is related to the magnetic field 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}$
\end_inset

 via
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{k}\times\vec{E}=v\vec{B}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 is a unit vector pointing in the direction of propagation, and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the velocity of the wave.
 This implies that the magnetic field of the wave points parallel to the
 interface.
 Ampere's Law provides another equation by demanding that the tangential
 component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\vec{B}}{\mu}$
\end_inset

 be continuous across the two media.
 The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the magnetic permeability of the material.
 This implies that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{-B_{i}}{\mu_{i}}\cos\theta_{i}+\frac{B_{r}}{\mu_{i}}\cos\theta_{r}=\frac{-B_{t}}{\mu_{t}}\cos\theta_{t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which, when combined with equation (27), yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\mu_{i}v_{i}}(E_{i}-E_{r})\cos\theta_{i}=\frac{1}{\mu_{t}v_{t}}E_{t}\cos\theta_{t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using equation (3) and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{E}=\vec{E}_{0}e^{i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

, we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{n_{i}}{\mu_{i}}(E_{0i}-E_{0r})\cos\theta_{i}=\frac{n_{t}}{\mu_{t}}E_{0t}\cos\theta_{t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

combined with equation (30), we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{E_{0r}}{E_{0i}}\right)_{\perp}=\frac{\frac{n_{i}}{\mu_{i}}\cos\theta_{i}-\frac{n_{t}}{\mu_{t}}\cos\theta_{t}}{\frac{n_{i}}{\mu_{i}}\cos\theta_{i}+\frac{n_{t}}{\mu_{t}}\cos\theta_{t}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An analysis along the same lines allows us to calculate the same ratio for
 the case of the electric field being parallel to the plane of incidence,
 which is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{E_{0r}}{E_{0i}}\right)_{\parallel}=\frac{\frac{n_{t}}{\mu_{i}}\cos\theta_{i}-\frac{n_{i}}{\mu_{t}}\cos\theta_{t}}{\frac{n_{t}}{\mu_{i}}\cos\theta_{i}+\frac{n_{i}}{\mu_{t}}\cos\theta_{t}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the case of transition between air and glass, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}\approx\mu_{t}\approx\mu_{0}$
\end_inset

, and the equations simplify to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left(\frac{E_{0r}}{E_{0i}}\right)_{\perp} & = & \frac{n_{i}\cos\theta_{i}-n_{t}\cos\theta_{t}}{n_{i}\cos\theta_{i}+n_{t}\cos\theta_{t}}\\
\left(\frac{E_{0r}}{E_{0i}}\right)_{\parallel} & = & \frac{n_{t}\cos\theta_{i}-n_{i}\cos\theta_{t}}{n_{t}\cos\theta_{i}+n_{i}\cos\theta_{t}}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reflectivities 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\perp}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the square of these equations, because the intensity of the
 wave corresponds to the squared magnitude of the electric field.
 For the case of normal incidence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}=\theta_{t}=90^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and using 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}=n_{air}=1,$
\end_inset

 we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{\perp}=R_{\parallel}=\left(\frac{1-n}{1+n}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{n-1}{n+1}\right)^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we have that for unpolarized light, 
\begin_inset Formula $R=\frac{1}{2}\left(R_{\perp}+R_{\parallel}\right)$
\end_inset

, and thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R=\left(\frac{n-1}{n+1}\right)^{2}
\end{equation}

Figure 6 shows the setup used for experiment 1.
 The meaning of all symbols used in the setup diagrams for the experiments
 can be found in Figure 5.
 We use a 0.5 ND filter to dim the beam of light by a factor of approximately
 3, and set up the flat mirror on a rotation stage as seen in the figure.
 The rotation stage and the mirror are initially positioned in such a way
 that the laser is reflected back upon itself.
 The nominal value of the wavelength of the monochromatic red light emitted
 from the laser is 632.8 nm, and the same laser is used throughout all five
 experiments.
 The setup's geometry implies that the reflected angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{r}$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\theta_{r}=90\textdegree-\theta_{i}-\arctan\left(\frac{X}{Y}\right)

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$

The setup for the second experiment can be seen on Figure 7.
 We set up the laser and the filter just as we did in experiment 1, and
 locate a flat mirror on top of a rotation stage that is perpendicular to
 the table, such that the mirror is able to reflect the laser beam from
 a certain height towards the table.
 The rotation stage and the mirror are initially set up in order for the
 mirror to be able to reflect the beam such that it strikes the table at
 an angle of 
\begin_inset Formula $0^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the normal to the table.
 This spot is taken to be the origin of the coordinate system shown in Figure
 1.
 We mark this on a piece of graph paper fixed to the top of the table.
 The graph paper is evenly divided in 
\begin_inset Formula $1\,mm^{2}$
\end_inset

 squares.
 Next, we measure the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{mt}$
\end_inset

 between the place in the mirror that is hit by the laser beam and the surface
 of the table.
 We proceed to fill a circular glass container with tap water, and measure
 the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{wt}$
\end_inset

 between the surface of the water and the base of the container.
 The mirror is then deviated such that the beam strikes the table at an
 angle, and we measure the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 between the origin and the new striking spot.
 Finally, we place the water tank on top of the table in between the laser
 beam and its surface, and record the new location 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 of the laser spot as seen from above.
 We repeat this for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, produced by rotating the mirror.

Figure 8 shows the setup for experiment 3.
 We place the laser in the same position as in previous experiments, and
 position the glass prism in a pedestal on top of a rotation stage, at the
 height of the laser beam.
 The starting position of the prism is such that the beam is normally incident
 with respect to its longer side.
 A beam stopper is placed behind the prism on top of a translation stage,
 as indicated in the figure.
 We proceed to measure the angle of minimum deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{min}$
\end_inset

 by rotating the stage with the prism into a position in which any further
 rotation to either side results in an increase in the deviation.
 We calculate the angle by measuring the horizontal and vertical distances
 between the prism and the location of the spot at minimum deviation, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, in terms of the measured variables, equation (15) is written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
n & = & \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\arctan\left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)+\varepsilon}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $45\textdegree$

Experiment 4's setup is depicted in Figure 9.
 The idea behind the setup is to reproduce the geometry shown on Figure
 3 for the incident angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and the displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 in order to calculate the refraction index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of the glass prism using equation (17).
 We place the glass slab on a pedestal attached to a rotation stage initially
 set such that the incident beam is normal to one of the long faces of the
 slab, which is verified by ensuring that the reflected beam hits the laser
 aperture.
 A razor bladed mounted on a beam stopper is located atop the translation
 stage directly in front of a photosensor as shown in the figure.
 The razor blade is positioned in such a way that it blocks half of the
 beam's intensity.
 Then, the slab is rotated until the intensity of the light reaching the
 photosensor diminishes significantly with respect to the intensity recorded
 in the previous step, at which point the translation stage is translated
 until the photosensor's reading comes back to its original value.
 The difference in positions is recorded by the micrometer attached to the
 stage.
 This is repeated several times in order to obtain multiple data points.
 The distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 between the slab's faces is measured with a ruler.

Experiment 5's setup, shown in Figure 10, is designed to replicate the geometry
 from Figure 4, in order to be able to find 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 and apply equation (25).
 The setup is simple: we place the prism at the same height of the laser
 beam on top of a rotation stage with an initial orientation like the one
 shown in the figure, and rotate the stage until the transmitted beam disappears.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 is then calculated in two ways: first, by calculating the angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\arctan\left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)$
\end_inset

, and then by directly reading it off the rotation stage, with the post
 holder in the figure being located at the position at which the transmitted
 beam disappears.
 The relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}=\alpha+\varepsilon-90\textdegree=\arctan\left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)+\varepsilon-90\textdegree$

Part A of this experiment is an attempt to measure the reflectivity of a
 flat mirror because it is to be used later in order to be able to calculate
 the reflectivity of the glass prism.
 Since it is not possible to measure the reflectivity at normal incidence
 directly without blocking the laser beam, we attempt to calculate it by
 first measuring the intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 of the unreflected beam, and then mounting the mirror in a rotation stage
 and measuring the reflected intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{r}$
\end_inset

 at small angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, in order to be able to extrapolate to the case of normal incidence.
 This is shown in Figure 11.

 Thus, we are able to calculate the transmission coefficient of the beam

In the third part of the experiment, we use two different setups in order
 to be able to calculate the reflectivity of the prism, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 Starting with the arrangement from Part B, we now place the photosensor
 90 degrees from where it was, and place the mirror in the photosensor's
 original position.
 We then measure the intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}$
\end_inset

 of the light that reaches the photosensor in this setup.
 Next, we perform the same procedure but with the prism instead of the mirror,
 and measure an intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 A naive analysis of the optical system would suggest that the equations
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

 would be
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{1} & = & I_{0}T_{bs}R_{m}R_{bs}\\
I_{2} & = & I_{0}T_{bs}R_{p}R_{bs}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{m}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the reflectivity of the flat mirror, and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{bs}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the reflectivity of the mirror when the beam is incident
 from the right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more careful examination, however, leads to the conclusion that equation
 (42) is incorrect.
 Due to the geometry of the prism, when the beam strikes one of its shorter
 sides at normal incidence, the transmitted wave undergoes a double reflection
 with the two other sides that adds to the intensity of the light reflected
 by the first air/glass interface.
 Let the incident beam have an intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

, and we have that the reflected intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{r}$
\end_inset

 is actually given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I_{r}=2R_{p}I_{i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}=I_{0}T_{bs}$
\end_inset

, which implies that the correct expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I_{2}=2I_{0}T_{bs}R_{p}R_{bs}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining equations (41) and (44) and solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{p}$
\end_inset

 gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{p}=\frac{I_{2}R_{m}}{2I_{1}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which illustrates why part B of this experiment was unnecessary.
 Now we can apply equation (37) and solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{p}$
\end_inset

, which gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n=\frac{-1-R_{p}\pm2\sqrt{R_{p}}}{R_{p}-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The sign ambiguity is inevitable, but in practice we end up using the negative
 sign because otherwise we get a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 that is less than unity.

\begin_layout Standard
The final part of the experiment involved repeating the procedure described
 in part A but substituting the flat mirror with the prism in order to find

 by the same extrapolation process.
 Again, care must be taken to account for the geometric effect described
 in the previous section.

\begin_layout Subsection
Procedures for data reduction and error analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use two different approaches to reducing the data measured.
 In the case of the experiments in which we can gather multiple data points,
 we apply the orthogonal distance regression (ODR) module of the Python
 library SciPy [3].
 This is a good way of accounting for the fact that our measurements have
 errors in both the dependent and the independent variables.
 The idea behind this algorithm is to minimize the merit function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\left[\frac{y_{i}-\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}f(x_{i},\vec{p})}{\sigma_{xi}^{2}+\sigma_{yi}^{2}}\right]^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the measured value of the dependent variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the independent variable,
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{xi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{yi}$
\end_inset

 a measure of their their standard deviations (taken to be their measurement
 error), and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{i},\vec{p})$
\end_inset

 an arbitrary model function of the independent variables and a vector of
 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

.
 ODR is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method described in [4], and this
 particular implementation is able to provide a best fit and a standard
 deviation for the values of the parameters in the model, which we will
 identify with the values of the quantities that we are trying to calculate
 from the experiment, as will be seen below.
 A more detailed examination of ODR is beyond the scope of this work and
 can be found in [5].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the cases in which we have only one (experiment 3) or two (experiment
 5) data points, we calculate the value of the quantity that we are trying
 to find simply by writing it in terms of the dependent and independent
 variables and applying error propagation.
 In the particular case of experiment 5, we calculate the two values for
 the refractive index independently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both cases we use the Python uncertainties package [6] in order to perform
 error propagation.
 This package allows us to calculate errors for complicated expressions
 that depend on the measured experimental quantities, whose errors we estimate
 from the practical difficulty of the corresponding measurement and the
 precision of the instrument used in order to perform it.

 should be a straight line with a slope

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\arctan\left(\frac{X}{Y}\right)=-2\theta_{i}+90\textdegree
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The deviation from such a line gives us a way of estimating how far from
 flat the mirror used is, and the subsequent deviation from the law.
 Figure 14 shows this plot.
 The best fit estimates for 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and

 returned by the ODR algorithm are 
\begin_inset Formula $m=-1.92\pm0.08$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=88\pm2^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 The errors for the measurements were estimated as 0.5 holes for the 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 measurements, due mainly to the fact that the mirror was not directly on
 top of a hole, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1^{\circ}$

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$

in Table 1.
 The errors in the measurements for 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 were estimated as to be consistent with the scale of the graph paper used
 to measure the distances, which was subdivided in 1 mm squares; as such
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta a=\Delta b=\pm0.5\,mm$
\end_inset

.
 An error of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1\:mm$
\end_inset

 was chosen for 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{mt}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{mw}$
\end_inset

, which were measured using a ruler with subdivisions of 1 mm, but which
 were in practice harder to measure accurately than 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$

Experiment 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment is simpler than the previous two because the refraction
 index of the prism 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 depends only on the constants 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{min}$
\end_inset

, which means that given 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, we can only measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{min}$
\end_inset

 once in order to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 We take 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=45\pm1\textdegree$
\end_inset

 and our measurements for 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $X=29.5\pm0.1\,cm$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=14.1\pm0.1\,cm$
\end_inset

, so applying equation (47), we get a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1.51\pm0.01$

 We estimated the errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.05\,mm$
\end_inset

, mainly due to the difficulty in getting the voltage in the photosensor

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Standard
We calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in two ways, again using only single measurements: by measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\arctan\left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)$
\end_inset

 (equation (40)), and by measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 (equation (25)).
 We take the errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.5$
\end_inset

 holes, and the errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 We find that for the first case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=51\pm2^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $n=n_{\alpha}=1.53\pm0.04$
\end_inset

, while measuring the critical angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 directly yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}=6\pm1\textdegree,$
\end_inset

 meaning that 
\begin_inset Formula $n=n_{\phi_{c}}=1.52\pm0.03$

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intensity of the light striking the photosensor is directly proportional
 to the photosensor's output voltage, with a constant of proportionality
 that does not change throughout the experiment.
 For Part A, we find that the unreflected intensity of the laser beam, in
 terms of the voltage read by the photosensor, is 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}=5.55\pm0.05\,V$
\end_inset

.
 We also find that the room lights contribute an offset of 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{lights}=20\pm5\,mV$

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $R_{m}=0.953\pm0.004$

 The intensity of light at the photosensor for case in which the mirror
 is placed opposite the beam splitter

 was measured to be

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of experiment 1 are consistent with the law of reflection, which
 requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}=\theta_{r}$
\end_inset

, although the agreement is not perfect, as we expected a slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $m=-2$
\end_inset

 and a y-intercept of 
\begin_inset Formula $b=90^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and the results were that 
\begin_inset Formula $m=-1.92\pm0.08$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=88\pm2^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 Even though these expectations are within the error bars, they are at their
 edge, which suggests that there might be some kind of systematic error
 involved.
 Most plausibly, the rotation stage was not zeroed to sufficient precision,
 and this can introduce a big error, in particular at small angles.
 It is also possible that the mirror's position with respect to the table
 was not recorded perfectly, since the mirror is not directly on top of
 the hole into which its holder is screwed to.
 More consideration to these sources of error should be applied in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiment 2's result agrees reasonable well with the expected value for
 the refractive index of water, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{w}=1.33$
\end_inset

.
 Sources of error in this experiment include the fact that the water used
 was not distilled water, and that it was not exactly at 
\begin_inset Formula $20\textdegree\,C$
\end_inset

, which are the conditions for which we expect to get 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{w}=1.33$
\end_inset

.
 Another, and potentially more important, source of error is that the container
 in which the water was held is made of a glass with a non-negligible thickness,
 and this should certainly contribute to the measured deviation of the laser
 beam.
 Finally, the laser beam's ~mm diameter might have introduced errors in
 the measured position of the spot with respect to the graph paper, as one
 has to calculate where the center of the spot is by eye.
 This becomes more complicated as the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 increases since the spot becomes elongated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nominal value of the refractive index of the glass prism used in this
 experiment and the slab used in the next one is 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1.517$
\end_inset

, so our result for this experiment of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1.51\pm0.01$
\end_inset

 is totally consistent with expectations, especially given the fact that
 a single measurement was performed.
 The minimum deviation was calculated by eye as the point in which increasing
 or decreasing the angle of the rotation stage led to the refracted laser
 beam to move away from the prism, and this procedure certainly introduced
 a degree of error.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 values were measured with a ruler, and the non-zero height of the laser
 beam also introduced errors as the location of the spot with respect to
 the table had to be calculated crudely by eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from this experiment are remarkably in line with expectations,
 as the refractive index is measured to be 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1.514\pm0.009$
\end_inset

, which yields a percent discrepancy of ~0.1%.
 This is related to the relatively large number of data points used, as
 well as the extraordinary precision of the micrometer.
 The principal errors involved are the uncertainties related to reading
 off the angles from the rotation stage, and getting the voltage measured
 by the photosensor to come back to its original value, because the voltmeter
 reading tended to fluctuate and only measured the voltage to a precision
 of 0.01 V.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two values for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 found in this experiment were slightly different, with 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\alpha}=1.53\pm0.04$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\phi_{c}}=1.52\pm0.03$
\end_inset

.
 Both agree well with the expected value for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, although the error bars are larger than in the case of the previous two
 experiments.
 This has to do with the relatively large errors involved in the measurements
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 In the first case, it would have been preferable to place the beam stopper
 at a larger distance away from the prism than was done, and in the second
 case, the fact that the angle is small and the rotation stage's reading
 is not very precise implies that there is a large error involved in the
 measurement.
 The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is not known to arbitrary precision also contributes to the resulting error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We get values for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.49\pm0.08$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1.49\pm0.02$
\end_inset

.
 Both results are consistent with expectations, although the expected value
 is slightly over the edge of the error bars in the second case.
 The origin of the large errors in the first case becomes evident upon inspectio
n of Figure 17, which suggests that a more precise voltmeter should have
 been used, as the variation of the intensity of the reflected beam is very
 small for the case of the flat mirror.
 Another possibility would have been dimming the laser beam further, but
 that would have added a scale factor into the equations because the filter
 would have had to be removed afterwards given the very small reflectivity
 of the prism.
 It is hard to explain why the intensity curve produced by the prism in
 Figure 18 is so well approximated by a Gaussian.
 The geometric effect described in section 3.6.3 explains why the intensity
 does not decrease linearly like in the case of the flat mirror, but it
 is unclear to us as to why a Gaussian model gives such a good result.
 It is also noteworthy that both nominal values found for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 are the same, and slightly less than the expected value.
 A more careful repetition of the experiment, with a better control over
 the sources of error, as well as performing a larger number of measurements,
 would be useful in order to resolve these issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have performed a series of experiments designed to apply some basic laws
 of optics that have allowed us to measure the refractive index of two different
 materials and to test the law of reflection.
 We find the results to be consistent with expectations, and that some experimen
tal methods yield better results than others.
 In particular, the setup in experiment 4 enabled us to calculate the refractive
 index of a glass prism to a precision of ~0.1%, which is about 10 times
 better than the accuracy obtained in the other setups.
 This reinforces the idea that different ways of measuring the same quantity
 are not equivalent in terms of their precision, even in the case of experiments
 performed in closely controlled laboratory conditions.
