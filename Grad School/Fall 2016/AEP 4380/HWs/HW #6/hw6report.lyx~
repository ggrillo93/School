\begin_layout Subsection
Solving Laplace's Equation Using Gauss-Seidel Iteration and SOR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of Gauss-Seidel iteration with successive over-relaxation (SOR)
 is a method in numerical linear algebra used to solve a system of linear
 equations.
 It can be used in order to numerically solve boundary value problems in
 mathematics and physics.
 A boundary value problem is a differential equation coupled with a set
 of conditions, or boundaries, upon which the solution will depend.
 Gauss-Seidel iteration works by elaborating the original problem in the
 form of a finite difference matrix that is then solved by repeteadly iterating
 over the matrix and changing the values of each of the matrix components
 based on the values of each of the components neighbors, starting from
 an initial guess.
 After a certain number of iterations, depending on the particular characteristi
cs of the problem, the components in the matrix will converge towards stable
 values that will correspond to the problem's solution.
 This algorithm is useful in the field of electrostatics, where it is often
 necessary to calculate the value of potentials and electric fields throughout
 a certain region of space, and it might prove difficult or impossible to
 do so using analytical methods.
 This homework will use Gauss-Seidel iteration in this context.

\begin_layout Standard
The potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\phi(z,\,r)$

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cylindrical coordinates, and assuming azimuthal independence, (1) becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nabla^{2}\phi=\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial r^{2}}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right)\phi(z,\,r)=0
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
Using a finite difference grid with 
\begin_inset Formula $z=ih$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=jh$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the grid spacing, the components of the finite difference
 matrix used to solve (2) are given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\phi_{i,j} & = & \frac{1}{4}[\phi_{i,j+1}+\phi_{i,j-1}+\phi_{i-1,j}+\phi_{i+1,j}]+\frac{1}{8j}[\phi_{i,j+1}-\phi_{i,j-1}]\,;\,j>0\\
\phi_{i,j} & = & \frac{1}{6}[4\phi_{i,j=1}+\phi_{i+1,j=0}+\phi_{i-1,j=0}]\,;\,j=0
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where the 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

's and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

's are coefficients known as the Dormund-Prince coefficients.
 The higher order solution is then given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{x_{n+1}}=\vec{x_{n}}+b_{1}\vec{k_{1}}+b_{2}\vec{k_{2}}+b_{3}\vec{k_{3}}+b_{4}\vec{k_{4}}+b_{5}\vec{k_{5}}+b_{6}\vec{k_{6}}+\mathcal{O}(h^{6})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereas the lower order order solution is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{x_{n+1}^{'}}=\vec{x_{n}}+b_{1}^{'}\vec{k_{1}}+b_{2}^{'}\vec{k_{2}}+b_{3}^{'}\vec{k_{3}}+b_{4}^{'}\vec{k_{4}}+b_{5}^{'}\vec{k_{5}}+b_{6}^{'}\vec{k_{6}}+b_{7}^{'}h\vec{f}(t_{n}+h,\,\vec{x_{n+1}})+\mathcal{O}(h^{5})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}^{'}$
\end_inset

 are also Dormund-Prince coefficients.
 The error in the current step is then given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{n+1}^{(i)}=\left|x_{n+1}^{(i)}-x_{n+1}^{'(i)}\right|
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\,2,\,3,...,\,N$
\end_inset

.
 The error is then scaled in order to adjust for the different magnitudes
 and units of the variables using a scale given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
scale^{(i)}=\left|x_{n}^{(i)}\right|+\left|hf^{(i)}(t_{n},y_{n}^{(i)}(t))\right|
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is used to find the maximum (relative) error 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{max}$
\end_inset

 in the series, via
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{max}=max\left[\frac{\epsilon_{n+1}^{(i)}}{scale^{(i)}}\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a predetermined maximum allowed error 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{max}$
\end_inset

, the algorithm changes the step size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 in two cases.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{max}\ll\epsilon_{max}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is increased via
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h_{new}=h_{old}\left(\frac{\epsilon_{max}}{\Delta_{max}}\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{5}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{max}>\epsilon_{max}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is reduced by an arbitrary factor 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h_{new}=\frac{h_{old}}{n}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last case, the current iteration step is repeated.
 The final 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x_{n+1}}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the next value of the solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
N-Body Gravitational Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Isaac Newton famously claimed that the stable orbits of the planets in our
 solar system were very hard to explain without assuming that providence
 intervenes now and then in order to preserve stability; that the gravitational
 interactions between the planets would necessarily destabilize their orbits
 given a sufficiently long period of time.
 He had no way of knowing this, however, since he didn't know how to analyticall
y solve the N-body problem involving all of the planet interactions.
 French mathematical physicist Pierre-Simon Laplace would later show that
 it was indeed possible for the solar system to be stable without requiring
 any kind of divine intervention, but the problem is conclusively regarded
 as analytically unsolvable, and so we have to rely on approximations in
 order to describe the motions of the planets over time.
 Each planet's motion is governed by the following set of coupled ODEs (assuming
 all objects are in the same plane):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\vec{v_{i}}}{dt} & = & \frac{\vec{F_{i}}}{m_{i}}=G\sum m_{j}\frac{\vec{x_{j}}-\vec{x_{i}}}{\left\Vert \vec{x_{j}}-\vec{x_{i}}\right\Vert ^{3}}\\
\frac{d\vec{x_{i}}}{dt} & = & \vec{v_{i}}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the initial positions and velocities, we can use Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
 in order to plot the trajectories of the planets over a certain period
 of time.
 The goal of this homework is to plot the trajectories of the Earth, Mars,
 Jupiter, and the Sun over a period of 15 years given two different sets
 of initial conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Task 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting trajectory plot for the first set of initial conditions is
 shown in Figure 1.
 This was obtained by running hw5a.cpp, which uses Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg to
 output the coordinates of each planet over a period of 15 years to a file.
 Figure 2 shows an amplification of the Sun's motion for the same setup.

Figure 3 shows the resulting trajectory for the second set of initial conditions
, which is different from the first one in that the velocity of Jupiter
 has been increased by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{4.7}$
\end_inset

 and its initial x-coordinate has been increased by a factor of 4.7.
 Figure 4 is the equivalent of Figure 2 for this set of initial conditions

\begin_layout Section
Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What the results show are that the first set of initial conditions result
 in a stable system with almost perfectly circular orbits, whereas the second
 set of initial conditions produce an unstable system with spiral orbits
 and potentially chaotic motion, in particular in the case of the motions
 of Mars and the Earth, which have smaller masses and therefore are easier
 to be upset by gravitational interactions.
 For the case of the Sun, we can see that it moves much less in the first
 case than in the second case, basically due to the fact that in the first
 case Jupiter is farther away, and as such exerts less gravitational force
 and also takes longer to complete a full orbit, while in the second case
 Jupiter's period decreases and its gravitational pull on the Sun increases,
 as it is much closer to it.
 Because the Earth and Mars are not big enough to significantly upset the
 Sun's motion, we see that the way the Sun moves is much more sensitive
 on Jupiter's gravitational attraction than on Earth and Mars's.
