Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stars are among the most important objects in astrophysics, and as such
 they have been studied using the methods of modern science for more than
 one hundred years.
 Early attempts at figuring out how stars worked were focused on attempting
 to learn more about the age of the Sun.
 When Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution by natural selection
 in 1859, a major argument against his theory was based on the idea that
 the Sun could not burn long enough in order for the extremely slow process
 of natural selection to have time to develop the immense variety of lifeforms
 that people were able to see around the planet.
 According to the physics of the time, the Sun was powered by the Kelvin-Helmhol
tz process, with the Sun's radiation being generated by its gravitational
 energy.
 Lord Kelvin famously calculated that this would only allow the Sun to shine
 for about 10 million years, a period of time not nearly large enough to
 allow for the types of organic transformations that Darwin had in mind.
 It wasn't until the discovery of nuclear forces, and the pioneering work
 of Hans Bethe in the early 20th century, that it became known that the
 Sun's energy originated from hydrogen fusion in its core.
 Around the same time, Ejnar Hertzprung and Henry Norris Russell introduced
 the now ubiquitous Hertzprung-Russell diagram, which classifies stars based
 on their luminosity and spectral temperature.
 In a sense, serious and successful stellar astrophysics took off at this
 point, as scientists attempted to derive the trajectories that stars of
 different masses traced on the HR diagram as they evolved, and also tried
 to explain their composition, which they were able to observe by examining
 their spectral signatures.
 Among their most spectaculars findings is the fact that the elements that
 make up organisms like ourselves were produced in the interiors of stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project aims to construct a simplified model for the structure of the
 Sun, and use numerical methods to calculate and plot stellar quantities
 of interest.
 This document is divided as follows: Section 2 describes the relevant stellar
 astrophysics and the approximations used.
 Section 3 discusses the numerical methods used and the structure of the
 implemented code.
 Results are presented in Section 4, followed by a short analysis in Section
 5.
 The code used is attached as an appendix.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Equations of Stellar Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structure of a perfectly symmetric, spherical star at a specific instant
 in time, and which is in hydrostatic equilibrium is governed by a set of
 four coupled differential equations, as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial r}{\partial m} & = & \frac{1}{4\pi r^{2}\rho}\\
\frac{\partial P}{\partial m} & = & -\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^{4}}\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial m} & = & \epsilon\\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial m} & = & -\frac{GmT}{4\pi r^{4}P}\nabla
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the star's radius, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 corresponds to its mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is its luminosity, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 its temperature, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 its density.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is the star's rate of energy production, and the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla & = & \frac{d\ln T}{d\ln P}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is known as the Lagrangian formulation, in which the independent variable
 is taken to be the star's mass.
 The Eulerian formulation, on the other hand, takes the radius as the independen
t variable.
 We will be working with the Lagrangian formulation, which has proven more
 popular in the context of numerical calculations involving stellar structure
 and evolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interpretation of these equations is straightforward.
 Equation (2.1) arises as a consequence of mass conservation.
 Equation (2.2) is the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium: the gravitational
 force acting inwards is exactly balanced by the force acting outwards arising
 from the star's pressure gradient.
 Equation (2.3) is the equation of conservation of energy: the rate at which
 the star releases energy is equal to the rate at which it produces energy.
 Finally, equation (2.4) is the equation of energy transport, and arises
 from thermodynamics.
 It describes the way energy moves outwards from the inner regions of the
 star to its outer regions, and subsequently to outer space.
 Equation (2.5) is trickier (which makes (2.4) trickier, too), as its exact
 form will depend on whether energy transport is due to convection or radiation,
 and will include terms that describe the opacity, which can be very complicated.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 are (in general) functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, and the star's chemical composition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These equations cannot be solved simply as initial value problems, or as
 regular boundary value problems: we do not have the proper boundary conditions.
 We know that, at the center, 
\begin_inset Formula $m=r=L=0$
\end_inset

.
 At the surface, there is more than one way of setting the boundary conditions,
 ranging from very simple to more complicated expressions.
 One possible choice, which we will take here, is to adopt the so-called
 radiative zero boundary conditions at the surface.
 We assume that there is a hard boundary between the star and outer space,
 so that at the surface, 
\begin_inset Formula $m=M$
\end_inset

, the star's total mass, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P=T=0.$
\end_inset

 Technically, these boundary conditions are not exactly correct, because
 there is no such thing as a hard boundary between the star's surface and
 its environment; however, it is possible to construct an approximate model
 using these conditions.
 In any case, we have four boundary conditions for four equations, as we
 don't know either what the pressure and temperature are at the center,
 or what are the star's luminosity and radius.
 This is an example of a two point boundary value problem.
 In principle, given a star's total mass, we can solve equations (1)-(4)
 for the respective dependent quantities.
 In practice, this is not a task that is easily accomplished in an accurate
 manner, especially because the equations can be unstable, and because the
 quantity described in equation (4) is notoriously difficult to calculate
 correctly.
 As mentioned before, its exact form depends on whether the transport of
 energy is radiative or convective, and that, in turn, depends on what region
 of the star is being integrated; another difficulty arises from the quantity's
 dependence on the opacity, whose value is extremely complicated to get
 right.
 Therefore, we will only attempt to solve the first two equations in order
 to find the central pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 and the radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 for a given mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 We will then rely on a series of approximations in order to get values
 for the the central temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{c}$
\end_inset

, the central density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{c}$
\end_inset

, the total luminosity 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{T}$
\end_inset

, and the temperature at the surface 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{eff}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Polytropes and the Lane-Emden Equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will model the dependency between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 by assuming a polytropic model,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P=K\rho^{\frac{n+1}{n}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is a constant of proportionality, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the polytropic index.
 This, however, introduces a new unknown into our equations, the parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 This parameter can be calculated for a given mass by solving the Lane-Emden
 equation, which will be derived below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us rewrite equations (2.1) and (2.2) by changing the independent variable
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial m}{\partial r} & = & 4\pi r^{2}\rho\\
\frac{\partial P}{\partial r} & = & -\frac{Gm}{r^{2}}\rho
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

We can combine these two equations into a second order differential equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r^{2}}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{r^{2}}{\rho}\frac{dP}{dr}\right)=-4\pi G\rho
\end{equation}

\end_inset

By introducing the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\rho_{c}\theta^{n}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P=P_{c}\theta^{n+1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\alpha\xi$
\end_inset

, we can define 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{2}$
\end_inset

 to be given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{2}=\frac{K(n+1)\rho_{c}^{\frac{1-n}{n}}}{4\pi G}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

With these new definitions, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{c}$
\end_inset

 is the central density, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 is the central pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 a dimensionless quantity commonly referred to as the polytropic temperature,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 another dimensionless variable, we can use (2.6) in order to express (2.9)
 as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\frac{d}{d\xi}\left(\xi^{2}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\right)+\theta^{n}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is known as the Lane-Emden equation.
 The boundary conditions for this equation are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\theta=1, & \frac{d\theta}{d\xi}=0 & ,\,at\,\xi=0
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the present context, we can regard this as the star's center.
 This explains why we require 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}=0$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=0$
\end_inset

: we need
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

at that point to be finite.
 From the definitions above, it should be clear that the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=0$
\end_inset

 represents the surface of the star, the point in which the pressure and
 the density go to zero.
 We define 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}$
\end_inset

 as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 at which this occurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now derive the relationship between the total mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, the radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
R & = & \alpha\xi_{1}=\left(\frac{K(n+1)\rho_{c}^{\frac{1-n}{n}}}{4\pi G}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\xi_{1}\\
M & = & \int_{0}^{R}4\pi r^{2}\rho\,dr=4\pi\alpha^{3}\rho_{c}\int_{0}^{\xi_{1}}\xi^{2}\theta^{n}\,d\xi
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After some lengthy manipulation, (13) yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M=4\pi\left(\frac{K}{G}\frac{n+1}{4\pi}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\rho_{c}^{\frac{3-n}{2n}}\left(-\xi^{2}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\right)_{\xi=\xi_{1}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Which can be combined with (12) to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R^{\frac{3-n}{n}}M^{\frac{n-1}{n}}=\frac{K}{GN_{n}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N_{n}=\frac{(4\pi)^{\frac{1}{n}}}{n+1}\left[\left(-\xi^{2}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\right)_{\xi=\xi_{1}}\right]^{\frac{1-n}{n}}\xi_{1}^{\frac{n-3}{n}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model will be made using a polytropic index of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

, which eliminates 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 from equation (2.16), and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}$
\end_inset

 in (2.17), and we end up with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M^{\frac{2}{3}}=\frac{K}{GN_{3}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N_{3}=\frac{(4\pi)^{\frac{1}{3}}}{4}\left[\left(-\xi^{2}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\right)_{\xi=\xi_{1}}\right]^{-\frac{2}{3}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lane-Emden equation is only solvable analytically when 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is 0, 1, or 5, so we will need to solve the equation numerically in our
 case.
 The procedure for doing so is described in section 3.3.
 The solution will enable us to calculate the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{3}$
\end_inset

 and, given a total mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, we will be able to derive 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, which will be assumed to be a fixed parameter.
 We can then use that value of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 to solve equations (2.1) and (2.2) using the shooting method (described in
 section 3.4), in order to find 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, since the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 polytropic relationship implies that (1) is now
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial r}{\partial m}=\frac{K^{\frac{3}{4}}}{4\pi r^{2}P^{\frac{3}{4}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ideal Gas Law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will approximate the relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 throughout the star by assuming an ideal gas.
 This has the effect of essentially eliminating equation (2.4), as 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 can be calculated at each step just by solving (2.1) and (2.2), and we can
 then calculate the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 by using the ideal gas equation, given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{k_{B}}{\mu m_{p}}\rho T
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}$
\end_inset

 is the Boltzmann constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the average molecular weight of the gas in units of 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}$
\end_inset

, the proton mass.
 For the chemical composition of the Sun, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.6$
\end_inset

.
 Since we are assuming a polytropic equation of state for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

, we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
P & = & \frac{k_{B}}{\mu m_{p}}\left(\frac{P}{K}\right)^{\frac{3}{4}}T\\
T & = & \frac{\mu m_{p}P^{\frac{1}{4}}K^{\frac{3}{4}}}{k_{B}}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

This is certainly a very crude approximation as far as the shape of the
 plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is concerned, so we will make no attempt to actually produce a model of
 the temperature inside the star at arbitrary radii.
 Instead, we will use this approximation in order to calculate the star's
 central temperature, and to approximate the total amount of energy produced
 inside the star via the pp-chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Energy Generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will make no attempt to produce an accurate plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 inside the star, because such a plot necessarily will depend on an accurate
 representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, which we already have determined will not be accurate given the assumptions
 described on the previous section.
 Thus, we will make no attempt to accurately solve equation (2.3).
 Instead, we will attempt to calculate the total amount of energy generated
 in the star by the following procedure.
 First, we will assume that all the energy comes from nuclear reactions
 involving the pp-chain.
 With that assumption, the rate of energy generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 can be approximated by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon\approx\epsilon_{0}\rho T_{7}^{\nu}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 are functions of temperature themselves, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{7}=\frac{T}{10^{7}\,K}$
\end_inset

.
 These functions are complicated, but we can construct approximations for
 them based on the following table of values, as given by [4]:

\epsilon\approx\frac{(aT^{3}+bT^{2}+cT+d)P\mu m_{p}T_{7}^{e\ln(T)+f}}{k_{B}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We will then use (2.22) to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 at each 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 This will only use this relationship to approximate the star's total luminosity
; as stated before, trying to use (2.22) to plot 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 will result in an extremely inaccurate picture.
 An accurate plot requires solving equation (2.4), which will not be attempted
 in this work.
 We will integrate (2.3) by using this approximation, but only to find the
 value of the total luminosity 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{T}$
\end_inset

, not to make a plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.

 Stefan-Boltzmann's Law for the luminosity of a perfect spherical blackbody

\begin_layout Subsection
General Considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in section 1.2.1, the physics behind equations (2.1)-(2.4) imply
 that this is not the kind of problem that can be solved simply by numerically
 integrating from a specified initial value, and stopping the integration
 at an exact final point.
 Since we will only attempt to solve equations (2.1), (2.2), and a simplified
 version of (2.3), as discussed above, we will decrease the number of variables
 involved, but at the same time we will be decreasing the number of boundary
 conditions.
 We will be solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, with the boundary conditions being that at the center, 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

, whereas at the surface, 
\begin_inset Formula $m=M$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P=0$
\end_inset

.
 First, however, we need to find the value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 parameter, which we will do by numerically solving (2.11) for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

.
 In order to do so, we will use a 5th order autostep size Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
 algorithm.
 The next section gives a brief overview of this algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
5th Order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method for numerically solving a system of coupled
 ODEs is an extension of the more basic 4th/5th order regular Runge-Kutta
 algorithms that has the added advantage of being able to automatically
 adjust the step size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 to be used by estimating the error at each iteration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a system of coupled ODEs of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{x}(t_{0})=\vec{x_{0}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is an independent variable, the algorithm calculates six 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 parameters in order to progressively reconstruct the solutions of the ODE
 system, and use the difference between a high order solution and a low
 order solution to estimate the error resulting from the use of a particular
 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 These parameters are given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{k}_{1} & = & h\vec{f}(t_{n},\vec{x}_{n})\\
\vec{k}_{2} & = & h\vec{f}(t_{n}+c_{2}h,\,\vec{x}_{n}+a_{21}\vec{k}_{1})\\
\vec{k}_{3} & = & h\vec{f}(t_{n}+c_{3}h,\,\vec{x}_{n}+a_{31}\vec{k}_{1}+a_{32}\vec{k}_{2})\\
\vec{k_{4}} & = & h\vec{f}(t_{n}+c_{4}h,\,\vec{x}_{n}+a_{41}\vec{k}_{1}+a_{42}\vec{k}_{2}+a_{43}\vec{k}_{3})\\

\vec{k_{6}} & = & h\vec{f}(t_{n}+c_{6}h,\,\vec{x}_{n}+a_{61}\vec{k}_{1}+a_{62}\vec{k}_{2}+a_{63}\vec{k}_{3}+a_{64}\vec{k}_{4}+a_{65}\vec{k}_{5})
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

's and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

's are coefficients known as the Dormund-Prince coefficients.
 The higher order solution is then given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{x}_{n+1}=\vec{x}_{n}+b_{1}\vec{k}_{1}+b_{2}\vec{k}_{2}+b_{3}\vec{k}_{3}+b_{4}\vec{k}_{4}+b_{5}\vec{k}_{5}+b_{6}\vec{k}_{6}+\mathcal{O}(h^{6})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

whereas the lower order order solution is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{x'}_{n+1}=\vec{x}_{n}+b_{1}^{'}\vec{k}_{1}+b_{2}^{'}\vec{k}_{2}+b_{3}^{'}\vec{k}_{3}+b_{4}^{'}\vec{k}_{4}+b_{5}^{'}\vec{k}_{5}+b_{6}^{'}\vec{k}_{6}+b_{7}^{'}h\vec{f}(t_{n}+h,\,\vec{x}_{n+1})+\mathcal{O}(h^{5})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}^{'}$
\end_inset

 are also Dormund-Prince coefficients.
 The error in the current step is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{n+1}^{(i)}=\left|x_{n+1}^{(i)}-x_{n+1}^{'(i)}\right|
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\,2,\,3,...,\,N$
\end_inset

.
 The error is then scaled in order to adjust for the different magnitudes
 and units of the variables using a scale given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
scale^{(i)}=\left|x_{n}^{(i)}\right|+\left|hf^{(i)}(t_{n},y_{n}^{(i)}(t))\right|
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is used to find the maximum (relative) error 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{max}$
\end_inset

 in the series, via
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{max}=max\left[\frac{\epsilon_{n+1}^{(i)}}{scale^{(i)}}\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a predetermined maximum allowed error 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{max}$
\end_inset

, the algorithm changes the step size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 in two cases.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{max}\ll\epsilon_{max}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is increased
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h_{new}=h_{old}\left(\frac{\epsilon_{max}}{\Delta_{max}}\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{5}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

And when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{max}>\epsilon_{max}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is reduced by an arbitrary factor 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, giving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h_{new}=\frac{h_{old}}{n}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the last case, the current iteration step is repeated.
 The final 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the next value of the solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This procedure is repeated however many times is needed in order to reach
 the end of the integration.
 We will rely on this numerical procedure to solve the Lane-Emden equation.
 The algorithm will also be a part of the strategy used to solve the two
 point boundary value problem given by equations (2.1) and (2.2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Solving the Lane-Emden Equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a polytropic index of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

, equation (2.11) becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\xi^{2}}\frac{d}{d\xi}\left(\xi^{2}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\right)+\theta^{3}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The numerical procedure described in the previous section requires us to
 express the equation to be solved in terms of two coupled first order different
ial equations.
 We can do that by expressing it in the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
2\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}+\xi\frac{d^{2}\theta}{d\xi^{2}}+\xi\theta^{3}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and performing the substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma=\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}$
\end_inset

, which gives:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
2\Gamma+\xi\frac{d\Gamma}{d\xi}+\xi\theta^{3}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d\Gamma}{d\xi}$
\end_inset

 yields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Gamma}{d\xi}=\frac{-2\Gamma-\xi\theta^{3}}{\xi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and thus we obtain a system of coupled first order differential equations
 in the required form,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\frac{d\Gamma}{d\xi}\\
\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\frac{-2\Gamma-\xi\theta^{3}}{\xi}\\
\Gamma
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boundary conditions were given in (2.12).
 Notice that because the boundary conditions are given at 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=0$
\end_inset

, and equation (3.19) contains a singularity at that point.
 This means that we need to start the integration some distance away from
 that point in order for our algorithm to work.
 This can be done by expanding (3.20) in a Taylor series at 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=0$
\end_inset

 in order to obtain an approximate value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=0,$
\end_inset

 and start the integration at that point.
 In other words, we assume that there exists a solution close to 0 of the
 form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\theta(\xi\approx0) & = & c_{0}+c_{1}\xi+c_{2}\xi^{2}+c_{3}\xi^{3}+c_{4}\xi^{4}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\mathcal{O}(\xi^{n})\\
\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}(\xi\approx0) & = & \Gamma(\xi\approx0)=c_{1}+2c_{2}\xi+3c_{3}\xi^{2}+4c_{4}\xi^{3}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\mathcal{O}(\xi^{n-1})
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boundary conditions require that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}=1$
\end_inset

.
 The rest of the coefficients can be obtained by plugging (3.21) and (3.22)
 into (3.20)
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I have done this using Mathematica, following the procedure in [5].
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We end up with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\theta(\xi\approx0) & = & 1-\frac{\xi^{2}}{6}+\frac{\xi^{4}}{40}-\frac{19\xi^{6}}{5040}+\mathcal{O}(\xi^{7})\\
\Gamma(\xi\approx0) & = & -\frac{\xi}{3}+\frac{\xi^{3}}{10}-\frac{19\xi^{5}}{840}+\mathcal{O}(\xi^{6})
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code used starts the integration at 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 It implements the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm and integrates until 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta<0$
\end_inset

, at which points it stops and records the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}=\Gamma$
\end_inset

, which is then used to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{3}$
\end_inset

 as per equation (2.19).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Solving the Two Point Boundary Value Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will attempt to solve the two point boundary value problem presented
 by (2.1) and (2.2), together with their initial conditions, as follows.
 Using the value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 parameter obtained via direct integration of the Lane-Emden equation as
 described in (3.3), we can rewrite (2.2) in the form shown in (2.20).
 We will use Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg to integrate, starting the integration
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 and some small distance removed from the center, at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=10\,\mu m$
\end_inset

, in order to avoid hitting the singularity
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An attempt was made to properly expand the solution near 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 in a Taylor series, in a manner similar as it was done in the case of the
 Lane-Emden equation.
 Unfortunately, the attempt was unsuccesful, as the code started behaving
 improperly for some unknown reason.
 Starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=10\,\mu m$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 circumvented the problem, but it seems like there is something weird going
 on here.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $P=0$
\end_inset

.
 We don't know the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 at the center, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

, so we start with an initial guess for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 and integrate until the point before

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A more straightforward way of doing this would be simply to integrate until
 
\begin_inset Formula $m=M$
\end_inset

.
 However, the value of (2.20) becomes complex once 
\begin_inset Formula $P<0$
\end_inset

 because of the 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{\frac{3}{4}}$
\end_inset

 term, and thus the code breaks down when trying to calculate the next value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We proceed then to record the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 at that point.
 Then, we quantify how well the chosen value of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 matches the boundary conditions.
 We do this by adding the absolute value of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 at the integration step immediately preceding the one in which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 becomes negative, to that of the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{m-M}{M}$
\end_inset

 at that same point.
 The closer this value is to zero, the better the match with the boundary
 conditions is.
 We repeat this procedure for multiple values of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

, after which we search for the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 that yields the least error.
 The code used relies on user input for three parameters: the lower and
 upper limits for the guess of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

, and the number of trial integrations to be performed over that range,
 each of which is separated by a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta P_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 After finding the minimum error, the integration is performed again for
 the corresponding value of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

, except now all the quantities calculated at each integration step are
 recorded in order to be able to produce plots of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

\end_inset

 of
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N_{3}=0.3639
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is identical to that found by Chandrasekhar, as mentioned in [6].
 We now use this result to calculate the value of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 for a star with 
\begin_inset Formula $M=M_{\odot}=1.999\times10^{33}\,g$
\end_inset

, the solar mass, using (2.18):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K=M_{\odot}^{\frac{2}{3}}GN_{3}=3.841\times10^{14}\,dyne\,cm^{2}\,g^{-\frac{4}{3}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

These will be the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 that will be used moving forward.

\begin_layout Section
Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software worked well.
 The Lane-Emden equation was solved properly, and the shooting method was
 able to arrive at roughly the same answer for the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

, even when the the guess range was quite wide.
 It could be improved by adapting it so that it always employs the same
 step size instead of the same number of steps as it iterates over the guess
 range, but this would require more computational time as the range increases
 in size.
 The simple scheme used to find the minimum error could be replaced by a
 more sophisticated Newton-Raphson method, or modified as to be able to
 distinguish instances in which it finds the minimum error at the end or
 beginning of the array, in which case the guess range could be made wider.
 A more sophisticated analysis would require the use of a relaxation method
 instead of the shooting method, as relaxation has proven to be more reliable
 in the construction of stellar models, especially ones in which the more
 complicated equation (4) is solved, and in which the star is evolved in
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adequacy of the Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that the model used is fairly accurate at modeling the
 Sun's central pressure, density, and temperature.
 The radius is consistently calculated to be about half of the actual radius,
 the luminosity is overestimated by a factor in the range between 2 and
 4, and the surface temperature is overestimated by a factor of roughly
 2.
 A better model would be required to alter the boundary conditions to account
 for the fact that the pressure does not actually drop to zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, given that there is no hard boundary between the star's surface and outer
 space.
 It would also have to actually solve equation (4) in order to be able to
 accurately describe the way the temperature changes in the star's interior,
 which would improve the luminosity calculations tremendously.
 Figures 4.3 and 4.4 provide a good comparison between this model and a more
 sophisticated one.
 On the Model S, the density and pressure go to zero faster than on the
 polytropic approximation used in this work.
 Given the crudeness of the analysis, however, the results are well within
 expectations.
